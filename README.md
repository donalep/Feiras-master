Finding where are Feiras available in Portugal

## Summary

For locals and tourists who are visiting Portugal to find what are the current available Feiras in the country.

## Background

Usually people in Portugal miss a lot of great opportunities of visiting very interesting Feiras in the country to buy cool stuff and meet amazing people.
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Knowing when the Feiras are going to be in advance.
* Knowing where are they going to happen.
* Knowing how to reach there fast and economic way.


## How is it used?

Simply people will subscribe to a weekly news email list which will show all information related to any Feira happening in Portugal During the current month and next month.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```

## Challenges

Being only informative about dates and locations of Feiras it doesn't have booking tickets to go there, maybe in the future.

## What next?

It will be colaborating with tourism, transportation and ticketing companies and apps to make a full service to reach to the Feiras.

* I was inspired from a personal experience of how much effort and time I need to reach or know about Feiras in Portugal.
